There are many fraction/rational Javascript libraries, but this one's
mine. :-)

There are two classes: Fraction and Rational. Fraction doesn't assume
the type of the numerator and denominator is anything more than an
integral domain. In other words, it doesn't try to reduce the fraction
to lowest terms.

Rational does assume the type is a GCD domain, and so it uses that to
reduce the fraction to lowest terms.
